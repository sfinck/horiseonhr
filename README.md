# horiseonhr

My goal for this assignment was to make Horiseon easier for collaboration between others to view and edit my project. I did this by reformatting the code in order to make the HTML and CSS file more accessbile. My motivation to build this project, or change rather, was the usage of semantic HTML. Through this I was able to revamp and remove all of the unecessary divs and label them in more of a uniform way. I started by changing the title of page to be more descriptive. I then moved onto the header which I changed to a nav because it contained a list. Next, I broke the main column into articles to divide them in a more uniform way. In addition, I added 'alt' to the images for description purposes and if the page doesn't load that description will take place of the picture. Also in the content, I switched the class tags to ID tags because the format was unique to that element. 

Some other changes I made was switched the parent div to an aside elemnent because the content was located on the right side of the page (outside the flow of text). In addition, I broke up the aside element into sections because they contained a thematic grouping of content. Lastly, I changed the bottom div to footer and added a <small> tag for the copyright portion.

Semantic HTML Element and Tag References:
Article: intended to be independently distributable or resuable
Section: thematic groupign of content 
header: top of document 
hgroup: main heading plus one or more sub headngs 
aside: intended for content that is not part of the flow 
nav: common to use i header and local nav in sidebar
footer: bottom of the document that contains general information 
small: used for copyright or legal disclaimers

  
During this homework assignment, I learned that detail is an important part of coding. It is vital to make every change in a document easy to trace for others who may view or edit your file. Being as thorough as possible is the key to saving time and allowing others to build off of your code right where you left off. 

I feel like my project stands out because I made comments for my changes leaving it easy for the viewer to see exactly what I changed.
